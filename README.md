Sentiment Analysis Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a sentiment analysis tool that can analyze the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of text data, such as social media posts or restaurant reviews. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to determine the emotional tone behind a body of text.
